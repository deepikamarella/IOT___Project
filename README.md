## ***Description***üìù
Air pollution is one of the major threats to today‚Äôs growing world. Therefore, due to ever increasing problems of Air Pollution in recent years, the IoT 
framework aims to constantly monitor Air pollutant levels along with Air Quality Index and 
the Air Quality levels are broadcasted on a web-based dashboard, which can be publicly 
accessed from anywhere. The proposed IoT framework solves the problems related to Air 
pollution by alerting the users to protect themselves for their well-being.

## ***Sensor Modules used***
* MQ-9
* MQ-135
* DHT11
* Dust Sensor Module (GP2Y1010AU0F)
* Wi-Fi Module (ESP-8266)
